2. `cd` into the directory and run `yarn` or `npm install`
3. Copy (`cp`) the `.env.example` file to an `.env` file
4. Run `yarn dev` or `npm run dev` to start the development server
5. Visit `http://localhost:8000/admin` to access the admin panel

## Frontend Development

Clone the [frontend](https://github.com/payloadcms/form-builder-example-website) and follow the instructions there to get started. You can use this repo as a backend for the frontend and see for yourself how it all works together.

## Usage

Once booted up, a `Basic Form` will be immediately available to view on the home page along with a few other forms on their corresponding pages.

- These forms are seeded into the `forms` collection.
- A few pages have also been seeded in on start up and utilize a layout building block called `Form Block` that is wired up to use the different forms from the `forms` collection.
- This is done by adding a `relationship` field in the form-block config and setting its `relationTo` field to the `forms` collection.
